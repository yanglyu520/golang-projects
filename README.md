# golang-projects
Some fun exercise learning and practicing with go lang

### Tips
1. golang pass the copy of the variable rather than the reference of the variable 
2. when it comes to the map and array, golang automatically pass the reference of the first element and it does not copy itself, so you do not have to use pointers all the time
