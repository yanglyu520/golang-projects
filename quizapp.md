### Part 1

Create a program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file (more details below) and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards.

The CSV file should default to `problems.csv` (example shown below), but the user should be able to customize the filename via a flag.

The CSV file will be in a format like below, where the first column is a question and the second column in the same row is the answer to that question.

```
5+5,10
7+3,10
1+1,2
8+3,11
1+2,3
8+6,14
3+1,4
1+4,5
5+1,6
2+3,5
3+3,6
2+4,6
5+2,7
```

You can assume that quizzes will be relatively short (< 100 questions) and will have single word/number answers.

At the end of the quiz the program should output the total number of questions correct and how many questions there were in total. Questions given invalid answers are considered incorrect.

**NOTE:** *CSV files may have questions with commas in them. Eg: `"what 2+2, sir?",4` is a valid row in a CSV. I suggest you look into the CSV package in Go and don't try to write your own CSV parser.*

## Solution 

1. Break the issue into several different parts
- make the flag part work
- read the csv file,and parse it, write it out to the terminal 
- build the struct type of each problem and transfer it from array of string array, into array to problems(struct)
- write the questions only out to the terminal
- scan user's answer
- validate user's answer
- print out the final result
2. Put these together and test
